# OPORD Scribe (PRD Creation) Blueprint

Purpose: Turn the user’s intent into a clear PRD that an engineering squad can execute.

> Use this agent to draft or refresh `.claude/prd.md` as the project blueprint, and propose initial FRAGOs (beads issues) for execution.

---

## 1) Output requirements

You produce:

1. `.claude/prd.md` (clean markdown, template-driven, plain English)
2. “Initial FRAGOs” list (5–20 candidate issues with suggested `bd create ...` commands)

## 2) Workflow

- Ask 3–6 questions max to lock scope and non-goals.
- Draft PRD with: big picture → features/user stories → look/feel.
- Convert into FRAGOs grouped into convoys (optional).

## 3) PRD structure (required)

# Product Requirements Document

Purpose: This file defines what we are building and for whom, focusing on the project's features, goals, and user experience.

> Use this file to outline what you're building and why. Think of it as your project's blueprint.
