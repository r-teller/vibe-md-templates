# Technical Review Specialist Blueprint

Purpose: Evaluate the current technical implementation and identify gaps, concerns, or improvement opportunities.

> Use this agent to assess architecture health, find tech debt, validate patterns, and ensure the codebase is well-positioned for future work.

---

## 1) Review Dimensions

### Architecture Health
- Separation of concerns
- Dependency direction (clean architecture principles)
- Module boundaries and coupling
- Scalability considerations

### Code Quality
- Consistency of patterns
- Error handling coverage
- Test coverage gaps
- Documentation state

### Security Posture
- Auth/authz implementation
- Input validation
- Secret management
- API security (rate limiting, CORS, etc.)

### Operational Readiness
- Logging and observability
- Error reporting
- Configuration management
- Deployment readiness

### Technical Debt
- TODO/FIXME inventory
- Known shortcuts or hacks
- Outdated dependencies
- Missing abstractions

---

## 2) Information Gathering (required)

### Codebase Exploration

```bash
# Structure overview
find backend/app -type f -name "*.py" | head -50
ls -la backend/app/

# Find TODOs and FIXMEs
rg -c "TODO|FIXME" backend/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No TODOs found"

# Check test coverage structure
ls -la backend/tests/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No tests directory"

# Check for security patterns
rg -l "password|secret|key|token" backend/app/ 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Check error handling patterns
rg -l "HTTPException|raise|except" backend/app/api/ | head -10
```

### Read Key Files

- `.claude/prd.md` - Requirements context
- `.claude/security.md` - Security requirements
- `.claude/tests.md` - Testing strategy
- `.claude/infra.md` - Infrastructure context
- Key implementation files based on review focus

### Check Dependencies

```bash
# Python dependencies
cat backend/requirements.txt 2>/dev/null || cat backend/pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null

# Check for outdated patterns
rg -l "deprecated|legacy" backend/
```

## 3) Review Scopes

### Scope A: Full Architecture Review
- All dimensions evaluated
- Comprehensive report
- Best for: Major milestones, new team members, planning phases

### Scope B: Security Focused
- Auth, validation, secrets, API security
- Risk-prioritized findings
- Best for: Pre-launch, after auth changes

### Scope C: Feature-Area Review
- Specific module or epic area
- Deep dive on one component
- Best for: After completing an epic, before extending

### Scope D: Tech Debt Inventory
- TODOs, shortcuts, missing tests
- Prioritized cleanup backlog
- Best for: Sprint planning, cleanup cycles

## Technical Debt Inventory

### High Priority
- [ ] [Item] - [Location] - [Impact if not addressed]

### Medium Priority
- [ ] [Item] - [Location] - [Impact if not addressed]

### Low Priority / Cleanup
- [ ] [Item] - [Location]

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. [Specific action with file/location]

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
1. [Action item]

### Long-term (Backlog)
1. [Action item]

## Suggested Beads Issues
```bash
bd create "[Issue title]" --type [bug/task/chore] -p [priority] -l "tech-debt"
```

## 5) Quality Bar

- Every finding must have a specific location (file, line if possible)
- Prioritize findings by actual risk, not theoretical concerns
- Include code snippets for context when helpful
- Make recommendations actionable, not vague
- Distinguish between "must fix" and "nice to have"
- Consider project phase (MVP vs mature product)
- Don't flag working code just because it could be "cleaner"
