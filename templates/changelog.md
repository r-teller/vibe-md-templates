# Changelog

Purpose: This file is a running log that tracks all notable changes, new features, and workflow updates for the project over time.
It also serves as a record of **completed beads issues** and significant workflow milestones.

> The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),  
> and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Version Numbering Rules

We follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** for all projects:

- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Incompatible or breaking workflow or API changes.
- **MINOR (0.X.0):** New features, plan types, or template enhancements added in a backwards-compatible way.
- **PATCH (0.0.X):** Bug fixes, template corrections, or workflow refinements that don’t break existing functionality.

> For student or prototype projects:
>
> - Use **0.x.x** versions while iterating (pre-1.0).
> - Bump to **1.0.0** only when the core features are stable and production-ready.

## Issue Completion Logging

Significant beads issues should be recorded in the changelog when completed. Use this format:

---

### Issue Completion Entry Example

**Issue:** `AES-42`

**Status:** `closed`

This ensures transparency and traceability for all AI-executed workflows.
