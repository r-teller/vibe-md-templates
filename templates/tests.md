# Testing Strategy

Purpose: This file outlines the strategy for testing the application to ensure it works correctly and prevent future bugs.

> This file explains how we'll test the application to make sure it works correctly and doesn't break when we make changes. A good testing plan gives us confidence to build and release new features.

## 1. Our Testing Philosophy

> What is our main goal for testing? We don't need to test every single line of code. Let's define what's most important.

- **Overall Goal:** [e.g., Ensure the most critical user journeys always work, Achieve 80% code coverage, Prevent regressions]

  - **_Example 1 (Local Python App):_**
    **Overall Goal: Ensure the core logic is correct.** The main goal is to verify that the data processing functions produce the correct output for a given input.

  - **_Example 2 (Next.js + Supabase App):_**
    **Overall Goal: Ensure the most critical user journeys always work.** We want to guarantee that a user can always sign up, log in, create a post, and view their dashboard.

## 2. Types of Tests We Will Write

> Different kinds of tests check different things. Here's a quick breakdown of what we'll use.

- **Unit Tests:** [Do we write these? What do they test? e.g., Yes, for individual functions and UI components in isolation.]
- **Integration Tests:** [Do we write these? What do they test? e.g., Yes, to check if our UI components correctly fetch data from the backend.]
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** [Do we write these? What do they test? e.g., No, not at this stage. OR Yes, to simulate a full user journey in a real browser.]

  - **_Example 1 (Local Python App):_**
    **Unit Tests: Yes, for individual functions.** We will write tests to check that each data transformation function works as expected.
    **Integration Tests: No.** The script is simple and doesn't have many integrated parts.
    **End-to-End (E2E) Tests: No.**

  - **_Example 2 (Next.js + Supabase App):_**
    **Unit Tests: Yes, for individual React components and utility functions.** We'll test that components render correctly given specific props.
    **Integration Tests: Yes, to check if UI components correctly interact with Supabase.** For example, we'll test that clicking the "Log In" button calls the `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` function.
    **End-to-End (E2E) Tests: Yes, for the login and new post flows.** We will write a small number of E2E tests to simulate these critical paths from start to finish.

## 3. Testing Frameworks & Tools

> What software will we use to write and run our tests?

- **Main Testing Tool(s):** [e.g., pytest, Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress]
- **How to Run Tests (Command):** [e.g., `pytest`, `npm test`, `npm run cypress:open`]

  - **_Example 1 (Local Python App):_**
    **Main Testing Tool(s): `pytest`**. It's a standard, easy-to-use testing framework for Python.
    **How to Run Tests (Command): `pytest`**.

  - **_Example 2 (Next.js + Supabase App):_**
    **Main Testing Tool(s): `Jest` and `React Testing Library`** for unit and integration tests. `Cypress` for end-to-end tests.
    **How to Run Tests (Command): `npm test`** for Jest, and **`npm run cypress:run`** for Cypress.

## 4. Key Test Scenarios

> Let's list the most important user actions that absolutely must work. This helps us prioritize what to test first. Think back to the "User Stories" in your `prd.md` file.

- **Scenario 1:** [e.g., A user should be able to log in with correct credentials.]
- **Scenario 2:** [e.g., A user should see an error if they try to log in with the wrong password.]
- **Scenario 3:** [e.g., A logged-in user should be able to create a new item.]

  - **_Example 1 (Local Python App):_**
    **Scenario 1:** The script should correctly parse a standard input file.
    **Scenario 2:** The script should raise an error if an input file is improperly formatted.
    **Scenario 3:** The script should produce an output file with the correct calculations.

  - **_Example 2 (Next.js + Supabase App):_**
    **Scenario 1:** A user can sign up for a new account.
    **Scenario 2:** A user can log in and is redirected to the dashboard.
    **Scenario 3:** A logged-in user can create a new post, and it appears in their list of posts.
    **Scenario 4:** A user cannot see or edit posts created by another user.
