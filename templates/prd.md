# Product Requirements Document

Purpose: This file defines what we are building and for whom, focusing on the project's features, goals, and user experience.

> Use this file to outline what you're building and why. This guide helps you and your AI assistant understand the project goals, features, and user experience. Think of it as your project's blueprint that everyone can reference.

> You donâ€™t need to be perfect here, just write in plain English. The AI will help refine.

## 1. The Big Picture (What are we making?)

> Start with the high-level overview. This section should give anyone reading this document a clear understanding of what you're building and who it's for.

- **Project Name:** [e.g., "Happy Plant Water Reminder"]
- **One-Sentence Summary:** In one simple sentence, what is the main purpose of this software? [e.g., "An app that reminds you when to water your houseplants."]
- **Who is this for?** Briefly describe the ideal user. [e.g., "New plant owners who are forgetful."]
- **What this app will NOT do:** List anything you want to specifically _exclude_ to keep things simple. This is very important! [e.g., "It will not identify plant species or connect to social media."]

---

## 2. The Features (What can it do?)

> List the main features as "stories." This is a great way to explain what the app does from a user's perspective. User stories follow the format: "As a [type of user], I want to [take an action] so that I can [achieve a goal]."

- **Story 1:** As a [type of user], I want to [take an action] so that I can [achieve a goal].
  - _Example: As a plant owner, I want to add a new plant to my list so that I can track its watering schedule._
- **Story 2:** As a [type of user], I want to [take an action] so that I can [achieve a goal].
  - _Example: As a plant owner, I want to receive a notification on my phone so that I don't forget to water my plant._
- **(Add as many stories as you need)**

## 3. The Look and Feel (How should it vibe?)

> Describe the visual style and the main screens of your app. You don't need to be a designer - just describe what you want users to see and experience.

- **Overall Style:** [e.g., "Clean and simple," "Colorful and playful," "Modern and dark."]
- **Main Colors:** [e.g., "Earthy greens and browns," "Bright pink and yellow."]
- **Key Screens:** List the main screens and what important buttons or text should be on them. You don't need to be a designer!
  - **Screen 1: My Plants List**
    - A list of all my plants.
    - A big button at the bottom that says "+ Add Plant".
  - **Screen 2: Add a Plant Page**
    - A box to type in the plant's name (e.g., "Ficus").
    - A dropdown menu to choose how often to water it (e.g., "Every 7 days").
    - A "Save Plant" button.
  - **(Add as many screens as you need)**
