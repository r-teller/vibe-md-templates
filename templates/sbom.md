## 1. Version Management & Updates

To keep the project secure and stable, we'll manage updates carefully.

* **Update Strategy:** Dependencies will be updated manually. Before updating a major version (e.g., from `1.x` to `2.x`), we will test the application to ensure nothing breaks.
* **Security Scanning:** We will periodically run `npm audit` (for Node.js) or a similar command for other languages to check for known security vulnerabilities.
